## Installation

1. **Clone or download** this project to your local machine

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Get your Suno API key** from the Suno API service

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Run the main application:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

The web interface will be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

### Using the Interface

#### 1. Generate Music
- Navigate to the **"Generate Music"** tab
- Enter your Suno API token
- Provide a music name/title
- Enter lyrics (paroles)
- Specify the music style
- Click **"Generate Music"**
- Files will be saved to `music/` directory

#### 2. Listen to Generated Music
- Go to the **"Music List & Player"** tab
- Click **"üîÑ Refresh List"** to see your generated music
- Select a music file from the dropdown
- Use the built-in audio player to listen

#### 3. Create Videos with Synchronized Lyrics
- Navigate to the **"Video Creation"** tab
- Click **"üîÑ Refresh Music List"** to see available music
- Select a music file from the dropdown
- Upload a background image
- Click **"üé¨ Create Video"**
- Videos with synchronized lyrics will be saved to `video/` directory

## Key Features Explained

### Synchronized Lyrics Video Creation
The application creates professional videos with:
- **Timestamped Lyrics**: Precise synchronization with audio using Suno API
- **Smart Caching**: Lyrics timing data cached to avoid repeated API calls
- **Text Animation**: Smooth fade in/out effects for lyrics display
- **Intelligent Text Wrapping**: Automatic line breaks for optimal readability
- **720p Optimization**: Videos optimized for 720p while preserving aspect ratio
- **GPU Acceleration**: Automatic GPU detection (NVIDIA/AMD) with CPU fallback
- **Encoding Fixes**: Automatic correction of UTF-8 encoding issues

### Organized Directory Structure
The application automatically creates and manages:
- **`data/`**: Contains `savedData.json` with metadata and cached timestamps
- **`music/`**: Contains all generated MP3 audio files
- **`video/`**: Contains all generated MP4 video files with synchronized lyrics

### Smart Lyrics Processing
The system includes advanced lyrics processing:
- **Structural Filtering**: Removes intro/verse/chorus markers from display
- **Word-to-Line Matching**: Intelligent mapping of timestamped words to lyrics lines
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation when API limits are reached
- **French Character Support**: Proper handling of accented characters

### Automatic API Key Storage
- API keys are stored with each music entry in `data/savedData.json`
- Video creation automatically uses the stored API key
- Timestamped lyrics are cached to minimize API usage

## Technical Specifications

### Video Creation Features
- **Resolution**: 720p with aspect ratio preservation
- **Font**: Arial with customizable size and stroke
- **Positioning**: Centered text at 75% screen height
- **Effects**: Fade in/out transitions for smooth display
- **Audio**: High-quality AAC encoding at 256kbps
- **Performance**: GPU-accelerated encoding when available

### Supported Formats
- **Audio Input**: MP3 format
- **Video Output**: MP4 format with H.264 encoding
- **Background Images**: JPEG, PNG formats
- **Text Encoding**: UTF-8 with automatic correction

## API Information

This application uses the Suno API endpoints:
- Music Generation: `https://apibox.erweima.ai/api/v1/generate`
- Video Generation: `https://apibox.erweima.ai/api/v1/mp4/generate`
- Timestamped Lyrics: `https://apibox.erweima.ai/api/v1/generate/get-timestamped-lyrics`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure you're running from the project root directory
2. **API Errors**: Verify your API key is correct and has sufficient credits
3. **Video Creation Issues**: Ensure background image is a valid image file
4. **Audio Player Issues**: Ensure your browser supports HTML5 audio
5. **Insufficient Credits**: The system will use cached data when API credits are low

### Video Creation Troubleshooting

- **Black Screen**: Check that background image path is correct
- **No Text**: Verify that lyrics exist in the saved data
- **Encoding Errors**: System automatically handles most UTF-8 issues
- **Slow Rendering**: GPU acceleration is attempted first, then CPU fallback

### Debug Mode

The application provides detailed console output for troubleshooting all operations.

## Development

### Module Overview

- **`music_generation.py`**: Core music generation logic, API calls, file downloading
- **`video_creation.py`**: Advanced video creation with synchronized lyrics and caching
- **`video_generation.py`**: Legacy video generation (basic functionality)
- **`gradio_interface.py`**: Web interface, user interactions, data display
- **`main.py`**: Application entry point and startup logic

### Adding New Features

To extend the application:
1. Add new functions to the appropriate module
2. Update the Gradio interface in `gradio_interface.py`
3. Test thoroughly with debug output
4. Consider caching strategies for API-dependent features
